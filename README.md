## A minumum effort Hugo boilerplate

Shugo is a hugo boilerplate with bells and whistles attached and grunt work done, so you don't have to.

Every line is to specification.

## Requirement

This website is built with hugo, so if you want to make changes to the templates or structures of the site, please first read about [hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/). But if you are just going to modify the data or update/add a post, you can simply follow the guide below.

## Getting started

It's recommended that you test the site locally before doing any push. To do so, first install [node lts](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Then enter this folder and run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Hugo will now generate the site and watch the directory and update the site when any changes are made. You can access the site at `http://localhost:1313`
